Some of the main tajwid rules that are explained and illustrated in Al Quran Tajwid Pdf 12 are:
 
- **Noon and Meem Mushaddad Rule**: It is that noon or meem that has a two-beat shaddah with ghunnah. Ghunnah is the nasal sound that comes out from the nose when pronouncing certain letters. For example: Ø«ÙÙÙÙ (thumma) and Ø¥ÙÙÙÙ (inna).
- **Al-Qalqalah Rule**: When any of the letters Qaaf, Ttaa, Baa, Jiim, or Daal is pronounced with sukoon or shaddah, it produces the vibration and sound known as al-Qalqalah. For example: ÙÙÙÙ (qul) and Ø£ÙØ¨ÙØ¯ÙØ§ (abadan).
- **Noon Sakinah and Tanween Rules**: Noon sakinah is a noon with a sukoon on it. Tanween is a double fatha, kasra, or damma on the end of a word. There are four ways to pronounce noon sakinah and tanween depending on the letter that follows them: idgham (merging), iqlab (changing), ikhfa (hiding), and izhar (clearing). For example: ÙÙÙÙ Ø±ÙØ¨ÙÙÙÙÙÙ (min rabbihim) has idgham, ÙÙÙÙØ¨ÙØºÙÙ (yanbaghi) has iqlab, ÙÙÙÙ Ø®ÙÙÙØ±Ù (min khairin) has ikhfa, and ÙÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙÙÙ (min amalin) has izhar.
- **Meem Sakinah Rule**: Meem sakinah is a meem with a sukoon on it. There are two ways to pronounce meem sakinah depending on the letter that follows it: ikhfa shafawi (oral hiding) and izhar shafawi (oral clearing). For example: Ø£ÙÙÙÙÙØ¦ÙÙÙ ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙÙÙÙØ­ÙÙÙÙ (ulaika humul muflihoona) has ikhfa shafawi, and ÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙØ¤ÙÙÙÙÙÙÙÙ ÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙØ¤ÙÙÙÙÙØ§ØªÙ (wal mu'minoona wal mu'minaatu) has izhar shafawi.
- **Prolongation (Al-Madd) Rule**: Prolongation is the extension of a vowel sound. There are different types of prolongation depending on the letters involved and their positions. For example: Ø§ÙØ±ÙÙØ­ÙÙÙÙ°ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ±ÙÙØ­ÙÙÙÙ (ar-rahmani ar-raheemi) has natural prolongation, ÙÙÙÙØ§ ØªÙØ·ÙØ¹Ù ÙÙÙÙ Ø£ÙØºÙÙÙÙÙÙÙØ§ ÙÙÙÙØ¨ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙ Ø°ÙÙÙØ±ÙÙÙØ§ ÙÙØ§ØªÙÙØ¨ÙØ¹Ù ÙÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ ÙÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ Ø£ÙÙÙØ±ÙÙÙ ÙÙØ±ÙØ·ÙØ§ (wala tuti' man aghfalna qalbahu an dhikrina wataba'a hawahu wakana amruhu furutan) has connected prolongation, and ÙÙÙÙ ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙ 8cf37b1e13

# How to Learn Statics and Mechanics of Materials Online
 
Statics and mechanics of materials are two fundamental branches of engineering that deal with the behavior of forces and deformations in structures and materials. Statics focuses on the equilibrium of forces and moments, while mechanics of materials studies the stress, strain, and failure of materials under various loading conditions.

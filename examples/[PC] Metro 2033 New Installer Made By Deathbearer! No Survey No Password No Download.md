Metro 2033 is not the only game in the Metro series. In 2013, a sequel called Metro: Last Light was released, which continued the story of Artyom, the protagonist of Metro 2033. The sequel also received positive reviews for its gameplay, graphics, and atmosphere, but it also had some technical issues and bugs.
 
In 2014, both games were remastered and re-released as Metro Redux, which included improved graphics, gameplay, and features. The Redux version also added two new modes: Spartan and Survival, which changed the gameplay style and difficulty of the game. Spartan mode made the game more action-oriented and gave the player more resources and abilities. Survival mode made the game more survival-oriented and gave the player less resources and more challenges.
 
In 2019, a third game called Metro Exodus was released, which expanded the scope of the game beyond the Metro tunnels and into the open world of post-apocalyptic Russia. The game featured a dynamic weather system, a day-night cycle, and a crafting system. The game also had multiple endings depending on the player's choices and actions throughout the game.

In this article, we will show you how to install and use PL/SQL Developer 9.0.6.1665 on Windows. This version was released on September 12, 2022 and includes bug fixes and enhancements[^2^].
 
## Step 1: Download PL/SQL Developer 9.0.6.1665
 
You can download PL/SQL Developer 9.0.6.1665 from the official website of Oracle[^1^]. There are two downloads available for Windows users:
 
- Windows 64-bit with JDK 11 included: This archive includes both PL/SQL Developer and an embedded copy of the Java 11 Development Kit (JDK). Simply extract the zip to a fresh directory and run the sqldeveloper.exe in the top directory.
- Windows 32-bit/64-bit: This archive will work on a 32 or 64 bit Windows OS. The bit level of the JDK you install will determine if it runs as a 32 or 64 bit application. This download does not include the required Oracle Java JDK. You will need to install it if it's not already on your machine.

We recommend using the first option as it is easier and faster to set up.
 
## Step 2: Run PL/SQL Developer 9.0.6.1665
 
After extracting the zip file, you can run PL/SQL Developer by double-clicking the sqldeveloper.exe file in the top directory. You will see a splash screen and then a welcome page.
 
If you are using the second option, you may be prompted to enter a JDK path. A valid Java Home on Windows will be similar to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.11.
 
## Step 3: Connect to an Oracle Database
 
To start working with PL/SQL Developer, you need to connect to an Oracle Database. You can do this by clicking the Connect button on the toolbar or by selecting File > New > Connection.
 
You will see a dialog box where you can enter the connection details such as the username, password, database name, host name, port number, and service name or SID. You can also choose the connection type (Basic, TNS, LDAP, etc.) and test the connection before saving it.

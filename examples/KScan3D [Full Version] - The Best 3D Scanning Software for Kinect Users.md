## What is KScan3D?
  
KScan3D is a Windows-based software that allows you to use your Kinect or Xtion sensor as a 3D scanner. It works by capturing depth data from the sensor and converting it into 3D point clouds. You can then use KScan3D to align multiple point clouds into a single mesh, delete unwanted points, smooth data, fill holes, reduce noise, and more.
  
KScan3D also supports multi-sensor scanning, which means you can use two or more sensors simultaneously to capture different angles of an object. This can improve the accuracy and completeness of your scans. You can also use KScan3D to scan human bodies and faces, and export them as STL, OBJ, PLY, or VRML files.
  
## What are the benefits of KScan3D?
  
Some of the benefits of using KScan3D are:
  
- It is easy to use. You just need to connect your sensor to your PC, launch KScan3D, and start scanning. The software has a user-friendly interface and guides you through the scanning process.
- It is affordable. The full version of KScan3D costs $299, which is much cheaper than most professional 3D scanning software. You can also download a free trial version that lets you scan up to 30 seconds per session.
- It is versatile. You can use KScan3D to scan objects of various sizes and shapes, from small figurines to large furniture. You can also scan people and animals with ease.
- It is compatible. You can use KScan3D with any Kinect or Xtion sensor that supports OpenNI drivers. You can also export your scans to various formats that are compatible with most 3D modeling and printing software.

- It requires a sensor. You need to have a Kinect or Xtion sensor to use KScan3D. These sensors are not widely available anymore and may be hard to find or expensive.
- It has limited resolution. The quality of your scans depends on the resolution of your sensor, which is usually low compared to dedicated 3D scanners. You may need to do a lot of post-processing to improve your scans.
- It has limited support. The development of KScan3D has been discontinued since 2016, which means there are no updates or bug fixes for the software. You may encounter some compatibility issues with newer versions of Windows or sensors.

## How does KScan3D compare with other Kinect 3D scanner software tools?
  
There are many other software tools that can turn your Kinect or Xtion sensor into a 3D scanner. Some of the most popular ones are:

- **Skanect**: Skanect is a similar software to KScan3D that lets you capture and process 3D scans using your sensor. It has more features than KScan3D, such as color texture mapping, hole filling, watertight mesh generation, and online sharing. However, it is also more expensive ($179 for the pro version) and requires more hardware resources.

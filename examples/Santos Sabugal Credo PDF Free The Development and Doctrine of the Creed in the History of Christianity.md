Santos Sabugal Credo is a book by Santos Sabugal, a Spanish Augustinian priest and theologian, that explores the history and interpretation of the Creed, the symbol of the faith of the Church. The book was first published in 1986 in Spanish, and later translated into Italian and Portuguese. The book covers the biblical, patristic, liturgical and doctrinal aspects of the Creed, as well as its relevance for today's Christians.
 
The book is divided into four parts: the first part deals with the origin and development of the Creed in the early Church; the second part examines the structure and content of the Creed, article by article; the third part analyzes the theological meaning and implications of the Creed; and the fourth part discusses some pastoral and ecumenical challenges posed by the Creed. The book also includes an appendix with various texts and documents related to the Creed, such as ancient creeds, conciliar definitions, catechisms and magisterial teachings.

- The Creed as a profession of faith and a response to God's revelation. The Creed is not a mere collection of doctrines, but a personal and communal expression of trust and love for God, who has revealed himself in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Creed is also a way of entering into communion with the Church, the body of Christ and the temple of the Spirit.
- The Creed as a summary of the Gospel and a rule of faith. The Creed condenses the essential message of the Gospel, which is the good news of God's saving action in history. The Creed also serves as a norm or criterion for interpreting the Scriptures and the Tradition, as well as for discerning the authentic faith from false teachings and heresies.
- The Creed as a prayer and a liturgy. The Creed is not only a doctrinal statement, but also a prayer that praises and glorifies God for his wonderful deeds. The Creed is also an integral part of the liturgy, especially the Eucharist, where it is professed after the homily and before the intercessions. The Creed connects the liturgy with the life of faith, and invites the faithful to live according to what they profess.

Santos Sabugal Credo is a valuable contribution to the theology of the Creed, and a stimulating invitation to rediscover and deepen the faith of the Church.

Some of the challenges that Santos Sabugal Credo addresses are the following:

- The challenge of understanding and explaining the Creed in a secularized and pluralistic world. The Creed is often seen as a relic of the past, a dogmatic imposition, or a source of division and conflict. The book shows how the Creed can be presented as a living and meaningful expression of the faith, a gift of God's grace, and a sign of hope and unity.
- The challenge of living and witnessing the Creed in a world of suffering and injustice. The Creed is not a detached or abstract affirmation, but a concrete and practical commitment to follow Christ and his Gospel. The book highlights how the Creed inspires and motivates the Christian to be a servant of God and a neighbor to all, especially the poor and the oppressed.
- The challenge of dialoguing and collaborating with other Christians and other religions on the basis of the Creed. The Creed is not a barrier or an obstacle, but a bridge and an opportunity for dialogue and cooperation. The book emphasizes how the Creed expresses the essential and common elements of the Christian faith, as well as the diversity and richness of its expressions. The book also explores how the Creed can foster mutual respect and understanding with other religions, without compromising or relativizing the truth.

Santos Sabugal Credo is a relevant and timely work that offers a fresh and dynamic perspective on the Creed, and a fruitful and inspiring guidance for the Christian life.

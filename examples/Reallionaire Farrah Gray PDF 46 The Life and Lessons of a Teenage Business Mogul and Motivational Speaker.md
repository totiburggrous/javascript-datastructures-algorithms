Farrah Gray is a remarkable young man who achieved financial success and fame at an early age. He is the author of *Reallionaire: Nine Steps to Becoming Rich from the Inside Out*, a bestselling book that shares his personal journey and his principles for wealth creation.
 
Gray was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1984. He grew up in poverty and witnessed violence and drug abuse in his neighborhood. His mother became seriously ill when he was six years old, which motivated him to find ways to support his family. He started his first business at the age of seven, selling homemade body lotion. He later sold painted rocks, comic books, and greeting cards. By the time he was 14, he had founded Farr-Out Food, a specialty food company that generated over $1 million in sales.

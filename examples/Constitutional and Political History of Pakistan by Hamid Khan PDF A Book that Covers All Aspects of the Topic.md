Some of the challenges faced by Pakistan's constitution are:
 
- The frequent suspension and abrogation of the constitution by military coups and martial laws, which undermined the constitutional supremacy and rule of law in Pakistan. The constitution has been amended several times by military dictators to legitimize their power and to curb the rights and freedoms of the people.
- The lack of consensus and harmony among the various ethnic, linguistic, religious, and regional groups in Pakistan, which resulted in political instability and violence. The constitution has failed to address the grievances and aspirations of the marginalized and oppressed sections of society, such as the Baloch, Sindhis, Pashtuns, Mohajirs, religious minorities, and women.
- The imbalance of power between the federal and provincial governments, which created tensions and conflicts over the distribution of resources and authority. The constitution has been criticized for being too centralized and unitary, and for not giving enough autonomy and representation to the provinces.
- The interference of external forces and actors in Pakistan's internal affairs, which compromised the sovereignty and integrity of the country. The constitution has been influenced by foreign pressures and interests, such as the Cold War, the war on terror, and the role of India.

These challenges have posed serious threats to the survival and stability of Pakistan as a democratic and constitutional state. The book suggests some possible options and solutions to overcome these challenges, such as strengthening the democratic institutions and processes, promoting national integration and reconciliation, devolving power and resources to the provinces, and pursuing an independent and balanced foreign policy.
